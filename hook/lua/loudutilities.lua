function TrackProj(projectitem, self)
    --LOUD has code that applies only to M28 and can cause wierd results like shells that fly through the air when targeting M28's units instead of hitting them; therefore disabled
    --(if the TrackProj code was put in due to a dislike of M28 units trying to dodge t1 arti/MML fire, it is noted that a game option (key M28DodgeMicro) is available for users to enable/disable such logic already via the game lobby options, with no need for providing auto-homing shots to all units against M28)
